- 1. Employee Headcount and Hiring Trends
- The company currently has 694 employees, and 319 new hires were made in 2021, indicating a stable hiring plan.
- 2. Gender Ratio
- The female employee ratio (51.9%) is slightly higher than the male employee ratio (48.1%).
- The overall gender balance is relatively even, but if certain departments have a significant gender disparity, further investigation may be necessary.
- 3. Departmental Employee Distribution
- The Sales Team (Sales Team 1 & 2) has the highest number of employees, while departments such as HR and CRM Office have fewer employees.
- This suggests that resource allocation across departments may need evaluation to ensure optimal workforce distribution.
- 4. Age Distribution
- The 30-39 age group represents the largest portion of employees, followed by the 20-29 age group. This indicates that the company primarily consists of young to mid-career professionals.
- There are fewer employees over 40, which could suggest a lack of senior professionals or challenges in retaining experienced employees.
- 5. Education Distribution
- The majority of employees have high school (36%), bachelor’s (26%), or master’s (23%) degrees.
- The educational background is relatively well-distributed, with only a small percentage having doctoral or associate degrees.
- If the company requires more highly skilled professionals, it may need to increase recruitment efforts for master’s and PhD holders.
- 6. Hiring and Resignation Trends
- Monthly hiring and resignation figures show significant fluctuations.
- Some months have higher resignation rates, requiring further analysis to determine potential causes such as salary competitiveness, work environment, or job satisfaction.
- August saw a noticeable spike in resignations, while hiring was relatively low, suggesting external or internal factors affecting employee retention.
##Advantages of the Dashboard
- 1. Data Visualization for Quick Insights
- Instead of manually reviewing Excel reports, managers can quickly understand workforce status through visual charts.
- 2. Identifying Trends for Strategic Planning
- HR can anticipate potential workforce shortages and create proactive recruitment strategies based on hiring and resignation trends.
- 3. Workforce Structure Optimization
- Understanding department-wise employee distribution ensures that critical departments have sufficient resources and avoids overstaffing or understaffing.
- 4. Age & Education Analysis for Talent Development
- Companies can tailor training programs based on the age and education distribution to ensure employees at different career stages receive appropriate development opportunities.
- 5. Improving Employee Retention & Satisfaction
- By analyzing hiring and resignation trends, companies can identify the reasons behind employee turnover and work on improving job satisfaction and retention rates.
##Conclusion
This HR analytics dashboard provides a comprehensive view of workforce management, helping the company make data-driven HR decisions. Through this dashboard, the company can:
- ✅ Gain insights into workforce demographics (gender, age, education, department distribution)
